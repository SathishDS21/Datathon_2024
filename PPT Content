Scraping a webpage while ignoring ads and focusing only on the main content can be tricky, especially since websites often mix advertisements with the actual content in their HTML structure. However, many websites wrap ads in specific tags, classes, or IDs that we can ignore when scraping.
To avoid scraping ads, you can:
	•	Target specific HTML elements that are known to contain the actual content.
	•	Ignore HTML elements that are typically used for ads (e.g., banners, sidebar ads, etc.).
