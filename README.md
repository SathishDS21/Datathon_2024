Components in the Code:

	1.	TF-IDF Vectorization: The text data is being converted into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with the TfidfVectorizer. This is a traditional technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to convert text into a vector form without using a pre-trained model like BERT or XLNet.
	•	TfidfVectorizer simply creates vectors representing the importance of words in the dataset without the deep contextual understanding provided by models like BERT.
	2.	Logistic Regression: This is a classical machine learning algorithm used for binary or multi-class classification. It is not a transformer-based or deep learning model. It’s a linear classifier that works well for many text classification tasks when combined with feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF.
	3.	LabelEncoder: This is used to encode the target variable (the category column) into numerical values, which is standard in machine learning when you have categorical outputs.

Key Points:

	•	No Pre-trained Language Model: The model is trained from scratch using TF-IDF features, which capture the frequency of words, and Logistic Regression, a simple linear model.
	•	Classical ML Approach: This is a traditional machine learning pipeline for text classification (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression), rather than leveraging pre-trained deep learning models like BERT or LLaMA.
